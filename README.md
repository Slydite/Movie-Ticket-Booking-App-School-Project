The project uses Java and SQL and acts as a local BookMyShow emulator of sorts. It has everything one would need to book a movie seat and some snacks.

This project helped me set up my foundations for OOP and DBMS.

Here is the [documentation](https://github.com/Slydite/School-Project--Movie-Ticket-Booking-App/tree/main/Documentation%20and%20SQL). (Do not use the pdf version)

I will be updating a way to build and setup the project soon.
